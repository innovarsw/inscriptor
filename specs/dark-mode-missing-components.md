Here is a list of components that look bad in dark mode - be fixing them, I will be adding more.

- [x] in TextEditor, the toolbar (bolding, etc)
- [x] in LeftMenu, the file rows, there was a hover effect in light mode, it is gone in dark mode
- [x] many components have blue background - while readable, it does not look good. In dark mode its white. Make it grey or something. An example: VariableSettingsDialog but it affects many components

- [x] in FileDetail, FileList and FileGrid views have messed up backgrounds, fix that
- [x] in FileDetailListItem, the hover is white and also if I expand file into its children, its white (the background is white and the text is white as well)
- [x] search for "Quick Reference" and "Workflow Examples" and darkify it
- [x] in dark.scss, improve the .q-card--dark  box-shadow, it is ugly right now

- [ ] the PromptSelector is not very dark mode friendly, fix it
- [x] ConsoleDialog.vue is not very dark mode friendly, fix it
